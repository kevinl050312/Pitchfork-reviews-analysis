    "### Is the sophomore slump or second-album-syndrome real? \n",
    "More specifically, is such a phenomenon observable from the Pitchfork album reviews? I think this phenom often refers to the challenge an artist faces in creating/presenting their second body of work after an immensely popular first, so in this case we'll look at scores of first albums that won BNM and then compare with scores of the subsequent album.  \n",
    "It occurs to me that one might be interested in seeing if the second album is also awarded BNM; however, due to possible biases associated with awarding BNM to consecutive releases (seeing if this does happen could be interesting to pursue as well!), I'll stick to scores.\n"
