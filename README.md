# Pitchfork-reviews-analysis
Data analyses on public Kaggle dataset of 18,393 Pitchfork album reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data), scraped by Nolan Conaway. I'm exploring the data through exploratory analyses, answering some of my natural curiosities, and following any other questions those might incur.

## Questions:
- [Is the sophomore slump real?](https://github.com/kevinl050312/Pitchfork-reviews-analysis/blob/main/second-album-syndrome.ipynb) More specifically, do artists whose first albums did well (received Pitchfork's Best New Music award) receive lower review scores on their second albums?
- Are a single reviewer's scores autocorrelated? I.e., can we really say that each review penned by an author is not affected at all by other reviews that the author has written?
